**Happening Now** is a modern, lightweight news and discovery platform designed to surface what matters *right now* — without noise, clutter, or agenda-driven overload.

In a world of endless scrolling and fragmented information, our goal is simple: **clarity, relevance, and speed**.

## Our Mission

We aim to make staying informed easier by organizing and highlighting trending stories across multiple categories in one clean, accessible experience.

Instead of forcing readers to jump between dozens of sources, Happening Now brings timely content together and presents it based on **interest, popularity, and relevance** — so you can focus on what matters most to you.

## How It Works

Happening Now curates and organizes content using structured data, research-driven insights, and trusted sources. Categories are designed to evolve as trends change, helping users quickly discover what’s gaining attention across the web.

Our platform is built with performance, accessibility, and transparency in mind — prioritizing a fast experience without invasive tracking or unnecessary data collection.

## What We Believe

- **Information should be accessible**, not overwhelming
- **Transparency builds trust**, especially online
- **User experience comes first**, always
- **Technology should simplify**, not complicate

## Our Vision

We’re building Happening Now to grow alongside its users — adding smarter organization, personalization, and tools that help people stay informed without sacrificing privacy or control.

This project is driven by curiosity, experimentation, and a belief that better information design leads to better understanding.

## Built for the Present

Happening Now is continuously evolving. What you see today is just the beginning — a foundation designed to adapt as the way we consume information changes.
